CONTROLS:
WASD or Arrow Keys to Move

SOUND WARNING:
There is sound in this project. Nothing loud. Just wind sounds/ambience, footsteps and birdsong.
But just saying it now, so that it doesn't catch you off guard.

Anyway, hope you enjoy this little interactive poem titled: "it was birdsong."

Now with collectables and voice lines that play upon collection!
