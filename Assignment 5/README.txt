CONTROLS:
WASD or Arrow Keys to Move

SOUND WARNING:
There is sound in this project. Nothing loud. Just wind sounds/ambience, footsteps and birdsong.
But just saying it now, so that it doesn't catch you off guard. (sorry I didn't have time
to make the footsteps sound varied, so it might get a bit annoying hah...)

Anyway, hope you enjoy this little interactive poem titled: "it was birdsong."

Now with collectables and doors that slide open!
